        <h1 id="title">Jalissa Lungrud</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Born into a small mining villlage in the northern mountains of Ismarak, tragedy struck when Jalissa 
            was just a young boy. During an accident clearing a new passageway, a large number of miners were 
            killed, including his parents. The leader of the local monastery, a man by the name of Dervahn, 
            dispatched help to the tragedy-stricken town, but it was too little too late. Unable to do anything 
            else, he took the young Jalissa into his custody, raising him at the monastery. However, as he entered 
            into adulthood, Jalissa was shaken by the realization that the monastery he had devoted his life to was 
            in actuality a cult. After being forced to kill one of his friends during his escape, Jalissa vowed to 
            never again take another life.
