        <h1 id="title">Theoldren</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Theoldren was born to an ancient family who had for countless generations been charged 
            with guarding the tomb of a minor god. One day, the naturally curious and inquisitive Theoldren forsook 
            his sacred duty to learn what secrets his family may have been guarding throughout the centuries. As he 
            pried the ancient tomb open however, he was distraught to find it empty, his family having been lied to 
            throughout the ages. His transgression did not go unpunished, as he was cursed to forever be haunted by the 
            spirits of his family members.
