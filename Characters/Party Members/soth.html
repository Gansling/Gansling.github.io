        <h1 id="title">Soth, the Slayer of Ghost</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Born to a small nomadic tribe in northern Ismarak, Soth was raised all his life 
            to be the next shaman for the tribe. However, as he reached adulthood, his fate would take an unexpected 
            turn. A great black dragon made it's roost at the top of the mountain, causing the sacred bear Ghost 
            to flee towards the foothills. As she encountered a pair of the tribe's hunters, she killed them in 
            her terrified desire to flee. Soth volunteered to slay the rampaging spirit bear, and after killing her 
            ate her heart in a tribal ritual. Consuming her heart caused her spirit to inhabit his body, preventing 
            him from being able to experience the spirit visions necessary for him to become the next shaman.
