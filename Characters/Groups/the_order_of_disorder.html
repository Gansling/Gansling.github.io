        <h1 id="title">The Order of Disorder</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">The Order of Disorder was the original group seeking to thwart the plans of the Cult of Erithos. 
            Brought together in the Ismaraki town of Linville in 3682 AA, the group of would-be heroes set out to
            hunt down the perpetrators of a kidnapping, unaware of what fate awaited them.

        <h2>Founding</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In September of 3682 AA, a group of unaffiliated adventurers would meet in Linville, in the Orolis
            province of the Kingdom of Ismarak. They had all travelled to the village for one reason or another
             during the annual harvest festival. As the festivities were underway, the group heard a scream from a 
             nearby alleyway. Rushing down it, they saw a group of robed, hooded individuals cast a teleportation 
             spell to kidnap a young woman. The group followed up on a lead that similar individuals had been 
             seen in the nearby Amarath fort. Bringing one of the guards in for questioning, he revealed that 
             they were part of a cult called the Cult of Erithos, and that the kidnapping victims were being taken 
             in to the Kingom of Renthal to be sacrificed. On behalf of the local authorities, the group headed into 
             Renthal, where they would uncover a far darker plot than they could ever have imagined.
